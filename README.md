## How do I install InkBox?
You can download precompiled OS/binaries [here](http://23.163.0.39/bundles/inkbox/native/) and standard Nickel add-ons (outdated, unmaintained) are available [here](http://23.163.0.39/bundles/inkbox/nickel/), although support for them has been stopped until further notice. Huge thanks to [@fermino](https://github.com/fermino) for providing free hosting.

On Windows, use [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) to flash the InkBox image file to the Kobo's SD card.

On Linux and MacOS, [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) is the easiest option for command-line-reluctant users.
Alternatively, you can also open a terminal and check the device node of the Kobo's SD card with `fdisk -l`. Then `dd` the image to the SD card like this:

```
xzcat inkbox.xz | dd of=/dev/mmcblk0
```
<b>IMPORTANT:</b> InkBox OS does NOT provide ANY WARRANTY at all and we are not responsible if you brick your device with one of the factory images or update bundles available online. See [legal information](https://github.com/Kobo-InkBox/inkbox/blob/master/LEGAL.md) for more details.

## How do I upgrade InkBox?
To upgrade InkBox, go to http://23.163.0.39/bundles/inkbox/native/update/ and copy the files for your device onto the `.inkbox` folder in the USB storage partition.

**Note**: Prior to version 1.6, InkBox had to be upgraded one version at a time. If your device's factory image ships with version 1.5, you need to closely follow the upgrade instructions [here](http://23.163.0.39/bundles/inkbox/native/update/1.6/HOWTO-Update).

If you install the Nickel add-on, unpack the 'base' archive in the root of the onboard storage, not in any subfolder inside it.

On the other hand, if you don't have the appropriate coding skills or just want to help in some way, feel free to make a donation at my [PayPal account](https://paypal.me/inkboxos/) or on [LiberaPay](https://liberapay.com/tux-linux/). I'm a student and motivation has been the only thing that has helped me maintain this project for the last months. Developing an entire operating system on my own was not an easy task. I have time, but I like to spend it wisely.
